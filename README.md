the program allows the user to choose the appropriate options for travel tours, hotels and modes of transport. 
The program code with a graphical interface is implemented in the work.
OO-paradigms (written hierarchies of classes describing the logic of the program) in Java are used. 
Implement the following operations under the thematic scenarios:
- creation and destruction of basic objects;
- combining them into composite objects;
- view and edit the main attributes of objects;
- search for individual objects and their groups (filtering) by several different criterions;
- Sort objects by several different criterions

PS if you have problems with JavaFX you can use test.bat for run (path Object-oriental-programming-on-Java/src/test.bat)
